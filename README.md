# Dynamic-Programming-Implementation-and-Experimental-Analysis
In this assignment, we will develop a deeper understanding of dynamic programming by coding (1) a straightforward recursive solution (2) memorized top- down version (3) a bottom-up version, to solve the following problems: a) Computation of the nth Fibonacci number b) optimal parenthesization for a matrix chain multiplication
